# portfolio-site

In this project I will be creating the bones and basics of a personal porfolio website
For this example I followed Mark pretty closely (exactly) based on our lab day
Site will include 3 Pages
  an Index (Home) page
  an About page
  and Portfolio page
I will include the necesary images for it to load correctly 
I did not focus on the copy/verbage much since Mark said we would be updating this soon
