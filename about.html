          I was born in Abliene Kansas, and graduated from the University of
          Kansas in 2016. After that I moved out to Denver where I found myself
          working at an Ad Agency and restaurant downtown. Eventually after
          commiting fully to the restaurant biz I moved to FOCO to help open a
          new store front for a sister restuarant where I was working in
          Denver...
