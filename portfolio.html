            I have spent the last 5 years managing bar programs for restaurants
            in the Denver and Northern Colorado area. This has included
            everything from full bar ordering, inventory, creating pricing
            spreadsheets, cockatil program curation and developement, and my
            favorite; scheduling special events

            and Bill Walton from a Grateful Dead festival called Skull and
